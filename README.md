# About Copilot Chat

This is a example copilot equipped with a "PresentationPlugin", designed for use during or before presentations. The main concept is to engage the audience by allowing them to input their interests, indicating the topics they're most eager to dive into during the presentation. The app features a secondary function that compiles a summary derived from collective feedback.

### Usin the plugin the Copilot can collect audience feedback before a presentation ðŸš€
